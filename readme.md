## Overview:
Thank you for your interest in translating our project! We appreciate your contribution to making our project accessible to a wider audience. Before starting, please ensure that you have read and understood the translation requirements mentioned below. This readme provides guidelines on how to translate our project using a template.

## Requirements:
To translate our project, you will need to have knowledge of the language you are translating into and English. 

You must be a native speaker or your level of knowledge of the language you are translating into and English must be close to perfect. Additionally, the .lang language file must contain code in accordance with ISO 639-1, which can be found at http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm. 

For example, if you are translating into English (United States), the file name should be en-US.lang. The file should also be in UTF-8 encoded yml format.

## How to:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a new branch for your translation work
3. Copy the en-US.lang file and rename it to match the ISO 639-1 code for your language. For example, if you are translating into French, the file name should be fr-FR.lang.
4. Open the file in a text editor that can save files in UTF-8 encoded yml format.
5. Translate the strings in the file, but do not modify any keys.
6. Save the file and commit your changes.
7. Create a pull request and wait for it to be reviewed.

Thank you again for your contribution! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.
